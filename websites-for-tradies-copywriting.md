## SECTION 2 — RELATABILITY HOOK

**[H2]**
Your website is sending customers to your competitor.

**[Body — short, punchy paragraphs]**
Before anyone calls you, they Google you. That's just how it works now. If your site looks like it hasn't been touched in five years, takes forever to load on a phone, or just doesn't show up at all — they're already calling someone else.

We've built websites for plumbers, electricians, landscapers, tilers, builders, and bathroom renovators across Perth. We know what works for each trade, and it's not the same thing twice.

---

## SECTION 3 — TRADE COMPARISON (This is the differentiator)

**[H2]**
Every trade is different. Your website should be too.

**[Intro line — 1 sentence, no fluff]**
The way someone searches for a plumber at 10pm is nothing like the way someone shops for a bathroom renovation. We build around that.

**[H3 — Trade Card]**
Plumbers and Electricians

**[Body]**
Emergency searches. Phone in hand. Stressed. Your site needs to load fast, show your number front and centre, and cover every suburb you work in. We make sure Google knows exactly where you operate so you show up when it counts.

---

**[H3 — Trade Card]**
Bathroom Renovators and Tilers

**[Body]**
Your customers are spending serious money and they want to see proof you can deliver. Your site is a portfolio first, a sales page second. We make your past work look incredible and build the kind of page that earns trust before you've even picked up the phone.

---

**[H3 — Trade Card]**
Landscapers and Builders

**[Body]**
Big projects, long decision cycles. Customers are comparing you against three other quotes. Your site needs to answer their questions, show your range of work, and make it easy to reach you. We build pages that do the selling while you're on the tools.

---

**[H3 — Trade Card]**
Carpenters, Painters, and Handymen

**[Body]**
Word of mouth gets you started. A proper website keeps it going. When a referral Googles your name and lands on something that looks sharp and professional, that's the moment you stop losing jobs you didn't even know you were competing for.

---

## SECTION 4 — HOW IT WORKS

**[H2]**
Simple process. No tech headaches.

We'll show you what we'd build and why, based on what's actually working for tradies in your space right now.

**[Step 3]**
**We build it, you get jobs**
We handle everything. You stay on the tools. When it's live, your site is working for you around the clock.

---
