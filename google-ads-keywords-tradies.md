## Campaign Recommendations

### Budget Allocation ($100/month)
With a $4.26 avg CPC on the primary keyword cluster, $100 gets roughly **23–30 clicks** per month. That's not a lot, so quality of the landing page matters enormously.

### Ad Group Structure

**Ad Group 1 — Tradie Web Design (Primary)**
- tradie website design
- website design for tradies
- tradie web design
- web design for tradies

**Ad Group 2 — Budget/Value**
- websites for tradesmen
- landscaper website

**Ad Group 3 — Test (Low/No CPC)**
- seo for tradies
- carpenter website design
- handyman website design

### Keyword Match Types
- Use **Exact Match** `[tradie website design]` to control spend tightly on a small budget
- Avoid Broad Match — it will exhaust $100 in days on irrelevant traffic
- Consider **Phrase Match** `"web design for tradies"` for a middle ground

### Landing Page Must-Haves
To convert these clicks (given the low click volume), the page needs:
1. Clear headline matching the search term (e.g. "Websites for Tradies — Built to Get You Calls")
2. Price or starting price visible above the fold
3. Before/after examples or portfolio of tradie sites built
4. Trust signals — reviews, number of tradies helped, trades served
5. Single CTA — phone call or contact form (not both)
6. Mobile-first — tradies are almost always on phones

### Negative Keywords (Add These)
Prevent wasted spend on irrelevant clicks:
- free
- diy
- template
- wix
- squarespace
- wordpress plugin
- how to
- youtube
