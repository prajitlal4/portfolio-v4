## SEO Optimization Strategy

**How to rank for BOTH broad and local keywords on the same page**:

Example for `/websites-for-plumbers`:

**Title Tag**: "Websites for Plumbers | Professional Plumber Website Design Perth"
- Targets both "websites for plumbers" (primary) and "plumber website perth" (secondary)

**H1**: "Websites for Plumbers"
- Exact match for primary keyword

**Opening paragraph**:
"We build professional websites for plumbers across Australia. As a Perth-based web design agency specializing in trade businesses, we understand what plumber websites need to convert visitors into booked jobs..."
- Establishes broad relevance + local credibility

**H2 sections**:
- "Why Plumbers Need a Professional Website"
- "Features Every Plumber Website Should Have"
- "Built for Perth Plumbers" (local section)
- "Plumber Website Packages & Pricing"

**Natural Perth integration**:
- Case studies from Perth plumbers
- "We work with plumbers across Perth's northern suburbs..."
- Testimonials from Perth clients
- Service areas mentioned naturally

**Meta Description**:
"Professional websites for plumbers. Perth-based web design agency specializing in trade business websites that generate leads. View our plumber website packages."

This approach:
- Primary optimization for broad keyword (URL, H1, majority of content)
- Secondary optimization for local (title tag, dedicated section, examples)
- Google indexes for BOTH search types
- You don't lose national ranking potential by geo-limiting the URL

---

## Key Design Principles

1. **Mobile-first**: Most tradies browse on phone during lunch breaks
2. **Fast loading**: No fancy animations that slow things down
3. **Clear CTAs**: Every page should have obvious next step
4. **Trust signals**: Client logos, testimonials, metrics everywhere
5. **Professional but approachable**: Not corporate, not too casual
6. **Scannable**: Short paragraphs, clear headings, lots of white space

---

## Metrics to Track

**Primary Keywords** (High Priority):
- "websites for plumbers" (140 vol, 3 KD)
- "websites for electricians"
- "websites for landscapers"
- "websites for renovators"
- "website for plumbers" (singular variations)

**Secondary Keywords** (Perth-specific):
- "plumber website perth"
- "electrician website perth"
- "landscaper website perth"
- "tradie website perth"

**Conversion Metrics**:
- Traffic to trade service pages vs resources
- Case study page engagement
- Pricing page conversions
- Contact form submissions by source page
- Time on page for each trade service page

**SEO Rankings**:
- Track primary keyword positions weekly
- Google Business Profile performance
- Organic click-through rates

---

## Notes

**Keyword Strategy**:
- Focus on broad, high-volume trade keywords FIRST (e.g., "websites for plumbers" - 140 vol, 3 KD)
- These have lower competition and national reach
- Naturally include Perth mentions in content without limiting the URL
- This approach captures both national AND local searches

**Content Approach**:
- Start broad in each trade page, then localize in the content
- Example: "We build websites for plumbers across Australia, with specialized expertise serving Perth plumbers..."
- This way you rank for both "websites for plumbers" (broad) and "plumber website perth" (local)

**Suburb Pages?**
- Skip individual suburb pages unless data shows demand
- Instead, comprehensively cover Perth suburbs on your single `/perth` page
- Add suburb-specific pages only if you see search volume or get repeated client requests from specific areas

**General Reminders**:
- Update case studies every time you complete a project
- Refresh guides every 6 months (update dates visible)
- Keep resources section lean - quality over quantity
- Every piece of content should answer: "Will this help me get more work?"
- **Use actual keyword data (like your SEMrush finds) to guide all decisions** - don't guess

**Expansion Strategy**:
- Nail these 4 trades first (plumbers, electricians, landscapers, renovators)
- Add more trades only if you land clients in those areas OR find good keyword opportunities
- Don't dilute focus by trying to serve every trade immediately
- Perth-based, Perth-focused in messaging, but nationally optimized in URL structure
